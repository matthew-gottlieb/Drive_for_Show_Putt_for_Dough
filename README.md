# Drive_for_Show_Putt_for_Dough!
Using Machine Learning techniques to analyze the relationships between Driving, Putting and success on the PGA Tour in 2019.

## Project Overview
The age old adage, "drive for show, putt for dough" has long been spoken in golf. However, what impact do each of these components have on getting a top finish on the PGA Tour? And most importantly, are good driving and putting statistics strong predictors of success?

This project uses data from the 2019 PGA Tour season, with the objective of better understanding the relationships of Driving and Putting with success on tour. It combines exploratory data analysis, multiple linear regression, and binary classification techniques to uncover these relationships, and make predictions about future performance on tour.
